I got involved into astronomy through outreach activities, instilling in me a strong commitment to provide younger generations at least with the same chances I had. For that reason, I serve as a teaching assistant and mentor students in their preparation for astronomical competitions and Olympiads, aiming to somewhat cover the absence of astronomy from my countryâ€™s curriculum. Acting as a role model for them has inspired me to continue encouraging aspiring scientists, particularly those from underserved communities. 

Additionally, I actively volunteer in my community, by co-organizing public events such as talks, stargazing events, solar observations, presentations and conferences. Apart from these roles, I am passionate about pro-am collaboration and open science. Thus, I engage in citizen science initiatives and author articles in platforms like [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/) explaining research in accessible language.

Astronomy belongs to everyone, and I believe it should be an inclusive space where people from all backgrounds can thrive. I am fully committed to fostering a diverse and welcoming environment in the field because I know that people from diverse perspectives bring innovative solutions to the table. Science is by humans, for humans, and it flourishes when we embrace the strength of our differences, ensuring that everyone has a voice in shaping our understanding of the universe. Through my work in education and outreach, I strive to make astronomy accessible and inspiring for all.
